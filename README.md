Advent Of Code 2023 attempts

Attempting in Java again this year since I'm currently studying a Java module with the OU. 

Main.java - runs whichever challenge we want to run, providing the input data as an array of strings. 

common - common classes - such as the file reader that can be used for all challenges. 

challenges - the challenge classes themselves. Each day has it's own class (eg. Day1, Day2, Day3 etc) with a run method that takes the input.
